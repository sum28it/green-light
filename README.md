Repo for **greenlight** project as part of Let's Go Further book by Alex Edwards
(found [here](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net)). It is the continuation book from his 
original, [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net), which was a great intro to Go web 
development book that I [just completed](https://github.com/sum28it/green-light).
